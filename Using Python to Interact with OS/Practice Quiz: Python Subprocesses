Question 3

When a child process is run using the subprocess module, which of the following are true? (check all that apply)
1 / 1 point

x The child process is run in a secondary environment.
    Correct
    
    Nice work! To run the external command, a secondary environment is created for the child subprocess, where the command is executed.

x The parent process is blocked while the child process finishes.
    Correct
    
    Excellent! While the parent process is waiting on the subprocess to finish, it’s blocked, meaning the parent can’t do any work until the child finishes.

The parent process and child process both run simultaneously. 

x Control is returned to the parent process when the child process ends. 
    Correct
    
    Right on! After the external command completes its work, the child process exits, and the flow of control returns to the parent.
